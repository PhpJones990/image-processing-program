I have made an Image Processing Program with C. And it works. Now I have to extend it to create an Image filter program with a GUI and add more filters. This is just my first step.

This program only works for the 24-bit bitmap image files. If you want to test this program, you have to change the image into a 24-bit bitmap image file.

1. Open the image that you want to filter with MS Paint.
2. Save as a 24-bit bitmap image file(.bmp).
3. Move the BMP image into the program directory.
4. Open a terminal in that directory.
5. Compile the program by typing "make" in the terminal.
6. To run the program, type "./img_p.exe "your_input_image_name" "your_output_image_name".
7. Then you will see the output image where the filter is applied.
8. Add "./" for bash. If you are using CMD, do not add "./"

If there is any error, you can contact me.
